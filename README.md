# tributary

A Clojure library to work with XPDL/BPMN.

## Objective

Intent is to support developers that require processing of business processes articulated in XPDL/BPMN resources.

## Usage

A bit to early to give any definitive usage direction. This is an experiment for me around developing 'something' open source.

Be warned, the current state will be turbulent whilst I hone the skills!
